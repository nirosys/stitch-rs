# Stitch Language

The stitch language is an experimental language for building flow-based programs.

This repo contains the rust implementation of stitch, which originally had been written
in Go.

## Goals for Stitch
The goals for the language are fairly simple:

- Provide a syntax that is fairly intuitive to read, but not too verbose.
- Provide constructs that allow code re-use, such as functions, macros, includes, etc.
- Provide constructs to allow automated schema discovery.
